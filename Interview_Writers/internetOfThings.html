			<h2>#1. Have you ever had a negative experience with Internet of Things?</h2>
			<p>We all have had our experiences with machines that don't act according to our expectations. But as I said, I believe that this is due to a temporary and false misconception on our side, rather than the intelligent machines.</p>

			<h2>#2. Where do you see Internet of Things in the near future?</h2>
			<p>I think it will lead to a highly intelligent and connected species that will be mainly concerned with the preservation of the earth, and possibly reaching further than that.</p>

			<h2>#1. We read your essays in the <i>Enter the Writers</i>, and we noticed you are interested in the Internet of Things. What was your first experience with Internet of Things?</h2>
			<p>It was about 8 years ago, when the concept got known in Holland. I read this Internet of Things booklet by Rob van Kranenburg, which really triggered me because it was the first time that I started to think about the physical environment communicating information about ourselves. Of course, we knew that the internet was seeing us and was collecting data about us. But reading the booklet made me realise how easy the environment could communicate data about us through and in between objects, which
			was really mindblowing. So how can you implement this, in a way that is constructive and not (only) commercial, that this interaction becomes interesting and a kind of empowering?</p>
			
			<br> <p>To experience and research the capacity of RFID (also in your OV chipcard), I created the performance installation DUETS. Every member of the audience received his or her personal RFID chipcard with video and audio data collected during the performance. The RFID card had to be put in a small case connected to the chairs on the tribune. A sensor measured the distance between the back of the chair and the back of the person sitting on that chair. </p>

			<br> <p> As a result, by moving on the chair, the audience was able to influence his own video, audio and light (all connected to the RFID card), as a result communicating with the performer on stage. My first daily life experience with the Internet of Things was the thermostat, that you can access through the internet, using your mobile phone. It is not much different from doing it on the machine itself, but one can access it from a distance and even connect it to other devices. This may lead to a lot of problems. What if the internet is offline and you want to change the temperature? Can other people hack your device? What data is collected and where is it stored?</p>
			
			<br> <p>At the moment, it is interesting to see what Waag Society is trying to achieve by giving devices to citizens to measure their environment. So, as a participant you would have a little system hanging at your balcony that measures temperature, sound and pollution. The data is then communicated and interpreted via the internet enabling us to know much more – and in real-time – about our environment than before.</p> 

			<h2>#2. Which products in your house are not connected to the internet, but you would want them connected?</h2>
			<p>I have to admit that I am a bit scared of taking those devices into my house. I have probably read too many stories about smart houses heavily installed with smart devices that turn crazy, and become impossible to control, assembling data and putting it up for sale. There are stories about new tenants that found their rented houses difficult to maintain, and not being able to disconnect some gadgets. </p> 

			<br> <p> How to handle the lights coming on at 7:00 every morning, the coffee machine making coffee while you want to drink tea, or when you aren’t able to stop the heater and you end up living in a sauna [<i>laughs</i>].</p> 
			
			<br> <p>I am more interested in the functioning of the Internet of Things, and at the moment research and try to formulate a future vision about it. For sure, it's not going to be done as it is now via the internet. Internet as it is, is not functioning and will have to change first (think in the direction of Blockchain).</p> 

			<h2>#3. Have you ever had a negative experience with the Internet of Things?</h2>
			<p>As I said, I don’t possess that many Internet of Things devices that one can buy at the store. In fact, I don't have any. I do find them fascinating, and don't oppose to them, and the devices I use for my interactive performances and installations, I design myself – in collaboration with Tim van Elferen. It is good to see though, that the discussion about how IOT should be designed, is starting. I just read there is an organization called The Internet of Women Things that is looking at the female perspective on home interior internet-of-things gadgets. Most probably, a female perspective on the Internet of Things in the house will differ from a male perspective.</p> 

			<h2>#4. Will the objects with internet of things technology take over or make us stronger?</h2>
			<p>We are stepping into a world in which everything becomes moldable and interactive. Things and objects will come to life and have their own behaviour (think of Siri). There will be no border anymore between our physical and the digital world. While there are so many possibilities, the question is, what to do? In what development do we want to invest? What are the ethical consequences? What kind of rules do we need? A lot of questions, but not so many answers yet. At the moment, I believe it is more about researching than giving it shape already. That's why, if we step in now, we can have influence on how we want our environment to behave.</p> 

			<br><p> If we leave all these decisions to the big companies, it becomes scary. For them it is about collecting our data and selling them, making money out of our digital daily (inter)actions and behaviour. We should rethink all the possibilities. We are now on the verge of re-designing a new society.</p> 
			
			<br><p> On every level, things are breaking down and a lot of small anarchistic movements are set up. In one direction, there are people that take extreme steps by turning their backs to technology, by not being connected to the internet and doing everythingin an a-technical manner. </p> 

			<br><p> I chose another direction, as I believe technology will be developed further, no matter what. How to design a sustainable and social environment incorporating technology and as I mention in my essay, not just be seduced by the possibilities? Some functionalities can be outsourced to the machines, other things belong to human action: the DIY mentality of the Fablab crossed with the knowledge of craftsmanship.</p>
