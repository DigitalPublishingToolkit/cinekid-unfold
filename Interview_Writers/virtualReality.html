			<h2>When I mention Virtual Reality, what is the first thought that comes to your mind?</h2>
			<p>For a long time, I felt opposed to the virtual reality devices. In the beginning of my research into the relation between body and technology, in order to connect to the digital world, one needed a keyboard, mouse and screen. I made a few projects
			that, combined the digital world and the physical world on stage, using laptops. People and performers were enabled to communicate via their digital avatars, among other things (performance installation AKI ANNE).</p>
			<br> <p>Then, Embodiment, became an important topic in my work and in society too. How to incorporate the whole body with all its senses, in the interaction with technology? The start of Kinects and balance boards, physical and haptic devices that enabled the participants to physically connect to the digital world. I created objects that had a variety of sensors embedded. These objects invited the audience to, interact with them, in order to communicate and connect to the digital world and at the same time stimulating them to focus on their own body (Cylinder_RollingStairs_Seesaw).</p>
			
			<br> <p>I missed this Embodiment in Virtual Reality, while the immersed experience, wearing the Oculus Rift was restricted to the eyes and ears. Putting on VR goggles, it enabled me to look around in the virtual world. I felt nauseous after the experience,
			though. It was because my head was immersed in the digital world, but my body was still here. The feeling was similar to being carsick, where the body is not able to catch up with the speed and the surroundings. Mind and the body become divided. After that, I stayed away from VR for a bit.</p>
			
			<br> <p>As a reaction, I created an installation in which separate body parts, like the arm, were connected to the digital reality: wearing an interactive glove that gave your arm an immersed feeling (PPI 1-3).</p>
			<br> <p>However, things have developed and now you can actually walk around in digital space while wearing VR headsets, creating a more embodied experience. This way, the disconnection between mind and body doesnâ€™t happen anymore. The installation <i>Treehugger</i>is a good example for this, in which it is possible to see, listen and sense the digital environment with the hands and via the back (small motors in a backpack), among other bodily sensations. It gets more interesting for me now!</p>
