		<h1> Marloeke van der Vlught </h1>

		<h2>We read your essays in the “Enter the Writers”, and we noticed you are interested in the Internet of Things. What was your first experience with Internet of Things?</h2>
		<p>It was a long time ago, when the concept got known in Holland. I read this Internet of Things booklet by Rob van Kranenburg, which really triggered my mind because it was the first time that you could really think about the environment communicating information about ourselves. Of course, we knew that the environment was seeing us. Reading the booklet made me think about the environment communicating data about us or through objects, which was really mindblowing. So how can you implement that, in the way that is interesting and kind of empowering? My first practical experience with the Internet of Things was with the thermostat, which you can access using your mobile phone. It is not much different from doing it on the machine itself, but now you could access it from a distance and even connect it to other devices. It was interesting to see what Waag Society was doing, giving devices to citizens to measure their environment. So, you would have a little system hanging in your balcony to measure temperature, sound and pollution, which will be connected to some other device, to convey the data. It was interesting to see the whole environment doing something by itself without us interacting much with it.</p>


		<h2>Which products in your house are not connected to the internet, but you would want them connected?</h2>
		<p>A 2) I will talk a bit about products I wouldn't want connected. I  have read some stories about smart houses heavily installed with smart devices, and how new tenants or owners found the houses difficult to maintain.  They found that it was hard to get the house back to its original state and to disconnect some gadgets. And what happens when the internet goes out? Or how about your heater, and you end up living in a sauna, when you aren’t able to stop the heater, through the WIFI? (laughs)
		I am most interested in the functioning of Internet of Things, than having a future vision about it. It's not going to be done as it is now. Internet as it is, is not functioning and we are growing into a new direction where everything will be thought of anew.
		</p>

		<h2>Have you ever had a negative experience with the Internet of Things?</h2>
		<p>I don’t have that many Internet of Things devices. In fact I don't have any. I do find them fascinating, and don't oppose them at all. There is an organization called ……, that is looking at the female perspective into home interior in the internet-of-things way. I think it will be an interesting find. Most probably, female perspective on Internet of Things will be different from a male perspective. We are stepping into the world where everything can be moldable and interactive, where there a lot of questions, but not many answers. It is more about researching it than giving it shape already.
		</p>

		<h2>Will the objects with internet of things technology take over or make us stronger?</h2>
		<p>If we step in now, we can design it in a particular manner. If we leave it to the big companies, it is scary. For them it is very much about collecting our data and finding a commercial way of surviving, making money out of our digital interactions. If I install a machine, it has to be properly maintained at regular intervals. This is the commercial picture, on how to get the data, what to do with the data, and maintenance of old gadgets, thereby persuading people to buy new things. It is in short, the subscription model. We should step in now and rethink of all the possibilities. We are now on the verge of re-designing a new society. On every level things are breaking down and there are a lot of movements on a small scale where people are feeling very anarchistic. These people are taking extreme steps to not being connected to the internet and doing everything in an a-technical manner. I think there is a road in-between, as technology is being developed further. This is the time to really think about designing this environment and as I mention in my essay, not be seduced by the possibilities. There are some functionalities that can be outsourced to the machines. </p>


		<h2>When I mention Virtual Reality, what is the first thought that comes to your mind? </h2>
		 <p>For a long time, I felt opposed to the idea of virtual reality. In the beginning to connect to the digital world, it was done by using a screen or device to connect to the internet. I made a lot of projects, combining digital world and physical world, using  laptops, where people would communicate with the digital avatars, among other things. The Embodiment, next, became a real topic in my work and in society too, where we had all these physical devices which enabled us to connect to the digital world. I made a lot of objects which had senses, with which interacting with them, you could connect to the digital world. That is the fourth part of the Internet of Things. I thought that Embodiment is a very important concept in Virtual Reality, which is not only restricted to having an immersed feeling in  fingers and hands, but also your entire body. It is the time of the connect, you know. I was making devices that had a haptic quality, refocusing attention to your own bodily way of connecting with the world. In the third phase of Virtual Reality, we lose the physical haptic devices, and our whole environment becomes moldable and interactive. When VR started, I was still into the concept of Embodiment. Putting on VR goggles, it would enable me to look around in the virtual world. I felt nauseous after the experience, though. It was because my head was immersed in the digital world, but my body was still here. The feeling was similar to being carsick, where the body is not able to catch up with the speed and the surroundings. The mind and the body had been split up. After that, I stayed away from VR for a bit.  I was involved in works where only the arm was connected to the virtual reality, like wearing a glove and having an immersed feeling, but only for your arm. And now with the latest developments, you can walk around in the digital space while  wearing VR headsets, creating a more embodied experience.The disconnection between the head and body doesn’t happen anymore. The installation Treehugger is a good example for this, where we can sense the digital environment with our hands, among other bodily embodiments. It gets more interesting for me now!</p>


		<h2>Can you share with us, some of your  interesting finds at the Cinekid Medialab? </h2>
		<p>I saw a very interesting artwork at the Medialab called Tafelgeheim, a virtual reality installation, which features a drawn animated conversation between a father and a daughter. They start to converse about owl pellets, but then get swallowed by memories of their family member Lisa: her sister, and his daughter. At one point, when the father is talking, you could feel yourself sinking into water. A few drawn lines had so much effect! It was a powerful experience, since the feeling of sinking into the water, was a-like being drowned in your sorrows. </p>
