                    <p> My name is Dirk Vis, and I write. I usually write with a pencil or with my laptop. But it’s interesting to note that you can write with all kinds of tools. I love tools like hammers, saws and cars. And I like lenses, cameras, typewriters
                        and computer programs just as much. I am fascinated by artists who make their own tools; artists who put energy and time into the development and selection of the right equipment. It is the work of these artists that especially
                        deserves your time, above other things screaming for your attention. </p>

                    <p> We can point to artists from thousands of years ago; ones who brought their depictions of wild animals to life by skillfully manipulating the 3D surface of a cave wall. They saw the cave as a tool for their drawings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux#Interpretation_of_images"
                            target="_blank">I'm talking about the Lascaux cave paintings</a>, of course. Then there is the tale of a film director who wanted to capture the appearance of light from 300 years ago in a film, and could only do by using the lens
                        used in telescopes built for space observation. Who other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Lyndon#Cinematography" target="_blank">Stanley Kubrick</a>? And what about the artist who could only make art by programming
                        his own social network, and finding images through it that were unimaginable elsewhere? That artist is <a href="http://metropolism.com/features/harm-van-den-dorpel" target="_blank">Harm van den Dorpel</a>. Personally, I get excited
                        by the idea of merging my stories with the possibilities offered by the smart AI, AlphaGo; the most advanced computer brain of our time. I want to use the neural networks of this artificial intelligence to give my work an extra
                        dimension, and explore senses that we all believe to exist, but are unable to hold, see, or prove.
                    </p>

                    <p>For me there is nothing more beautiful than someone writing a poem on their iPhone which proves that animals can talk. Or using a cloud-based collaboration tool to show my friends that the afterlife is at your fingertips. I write stories
                        with pen and paper, but I also write travel stories with that flashing blue dot in Google Maps. I write fables with hatchets, or with the LED screens of Times Square. And I would like to write poems using my portable typewriter
                        or the gyroscope that’s in your phone.</p>
