              <p> We react emotionally when we recognise elements of ‘human behavior’ in an object or a space. Ruairi Glenn explores this fact in his artistic practice and as coordinator of the Interactive Architecture Lab.
In response to my question of how Ruairi sees the relationship between people and his designed ‘living’ architecture, he talks about Fearful Symmetry. He made this installation in 2012, especially for the opening program of The Tanks at the Tate Modern. </p>

 <p> Ruairi: Tanks consisted of dark rooms and spaces that had not been opened to the public for some 30 years. I wanted to reveal these spaces, inviting the public to discover them by literally shining a light into them. The title, Fearful Symmetry is from the poem The Tyger by William Blake. In this poem an awful creature appears out of the darkness. For me, the poem about the challenge of awakening something into life: how can you create something so terrible? This creature was the character, and I wanted to show that. Something that initially terrifies you, but something that you can evenntually connect with. </p>
 <p> That is the underlying story, but the experience of the installation itself is non-linear. The whole room is dark when the audience enters. A triangular object hangs from the ceiling; a robot which can move along a line of twenty metres’ length. The triangle emits light and moves through space. Sometimes it seems to follow the visitor, and at oher times it remains still, or moves in another direction. The crowd reacted very differently. Some stood watching on the side, whilst others tried to communicate with the robot. </p>
 <p> I see Fearful Symmetry as an exercise in abstraction and complexity. Namely, how the shape of the object can be abstracted, or seen as living, by the public? And how simple or complex should its behaviour be, in order to elicit the public’s emotional involvement? </p>

 <p> Marloeke: So in this work you - as the creator - research how this psychological game between people and an object works. The object in Fear Full Symmetry determines whether, and how it is communicated. The audience reacts accordingly and actually forms a test group for you. What are your thoughts on this one-sided relationship where the robot or the technology seems to be more powerful than people? </p>
 <p> Ruairi: I am aware of the fact that when something comes alive, it has a very emotional effect on us. I do not know if this is a good or bad thing, but as of yet, only a few designers have thought about this process. They are employed by large companies, who also employ a large team of psychologists to undertake research into this field. The result is the Google Car that winks at you and keeps the door open for you, or Siri from Apple that talks to you in a familiar manner with each update. They seem as innocent as Mickey Mouse, but all of these things represent large and powerful companies. The best course is to delve deeper into the relationship between machine and psychology so that you as a designer can make your own conscious choices. </p>
