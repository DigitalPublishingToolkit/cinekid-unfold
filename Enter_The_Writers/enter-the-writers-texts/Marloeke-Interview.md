Interview with Marloeke van der Vlught (author of the essay *Smart illusion* )
==============================================================================

\#1. We read your essays in the *Enter the Writers*, and we noticed you are interested in the Internet of Things. What was your first experience with Internet of Things?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was about 8 years ago, when the concept got more attention in
Holland. I read the *Internet of Things* booklet by Rob van Kranenburg,
that really triggered me because it was the first time that I started to
think about the physical environment collecting and communicating
information about our behavior. Of course, we knew that the internet was
seeing us but reading the booklet made me realize that the environment
could actually follow our data - through and in between objects like
clothing and phones - and also react to this data, which was really
mind-blowing. So how can you implement this interaction, in a way that
is constructive and not (only) commercial, that it becomes interesting
and a kind of empowering?

To experience and research the capacity of RFID (also in your OV
chipcard), I created the performance installation DUETS^1^. Every member
of the audience received his or her personal RFID chipcard with video
and audio data collected during the performance. The RFID card had to be
put in a small case connected to the chairs on the tribune. A sensor
measured the distance between the back of the chair and the back of the
person sitting on that chair. As a result, by moving on the chair, the
audience was able to influence his own video- and audio-files and put
the lights on stage on or off (all connected to the RFID card), like
this communicating with the live performer on stage.

My first daily life experience with the Internet of Things was the
thermostat, which you can access through the internet, using your mobile
phone. It is not much different from doing it on the machine itself, but
one can access it from a distance and even connect it to other devices.
This may lead to a lot of problems. What if the internet is offline and
you want to change the temperature? Can other people hack your device?
What data is collected and where is it stored?

At the moment, it is interesting to see what Waag Society^2^ is trying
to achieve by giving smart-citizens-lab, smart devices to citizens to
measure their environment. So, as a participant you would have a little
system hanging at your balcony that measures temperature, sound and
pollution. The data is then communicated and interpreted via the
internet enabling us to know much more – and in real-time – about our
environment than before.

\#2. Which products in your house are not connected to the internet, but you would want them connected?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have to admit that I am a bit scared of taking those devices into my
house. I have probably read too many stories about modern houses heavily
installed with smart devices that turn crazy, and become impossible to
control, assembling data and putting it up for sale. There are stories
about new tenants that found their rented houses difficult to maintain,
while they were not able to reprogram or even disconnect some basic
gadgets. How to handle when the lights switch on at 7.00 AM every
morning, the coffee machine makes coffee while you want to drink tea, or
the heater is set to 28 degrees and you end up living in a sauna
[laughs]. I am more interested in the functioning of the Internet of
Things, and at the moment, research and try to formulate a future vision
about it. For sure, it’s not going to be done as it is now via the
internet. Internet as it is, is not functioning and will have to change
first (think in the direction of Blockchain^3^).

\#3. Have you ever had a negative experience with the Internet of Things?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I said, I don’t possess Internet of Things devices that one can buy
at the store. I do find them fascinating and don’t oppose to them. The
devices I use for my interactive performances and installations, I
design myself – in collaboration with Tim van Elferen. It is good to see
though, that the discussion about how Internet of Things should be
designed, is starting. I just read there is an organization called The
Internet of Women Things^4^ that is looking at the female perspective on
home interior internet-of-things gadgets. Most probably, a female
perspective on the Internet of Things in the house will differ from a
male perspective.

\#4. Will the objects with Internet of Things technology take over or make us stronger?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are growing towards a world in which everything becomes moldable and
interactive. Things and objects will come to life and have their own
behaviour (think of Siri). There will be no border anymore between our
physical and the digital world. While there are so many possibilities,
the question is, what to do? In what development do we want to invest?
What are the ethical consequences? What kind of rules do we need? A lot
of questions, but not so many answers yet. At the moment, I believe it
is more about researching than giving it shape already. That’s why, if
we step in now, we can still have influence on how we want our
environment to behave. If we leave all these decisions to the big
companies, it becomes scary. For them it is about collecting our data
and selling them, making money out of our digital daily (inter)actions
and behaviour. We should rethink all the possibilities. We are now on
the verge of re-designing a new society. On every level, things are
breaking down and a lot of small anarchistic movements are set up. In
one direction, there are people that take extreme steps by turning their
backs to technology, by not being connected to the internet and doing
everything in an a-technical manner. I chose another direction, as I
believe technology will be developed further, no matter what. For me the
question is: how to think about a sustainable and social environment
incorporating technology and - as I mention in my essay - not just be
seduced by the possibilities? Some functionalities can be outsourced to
the machines, other things belong to human action: the Do-It-Yourself
mentality of the Fablabs crossed with the knowledge of craftsmanship.

\#5. When I mention Virtual Reality, what is the first thought that comes to your mind?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a long time, I felt a bit opposed to the virtual reality devices
while I missed a sense of "embodiment" in this experience. Let me
explain this. At the beginning of my research into the relationship
between body and technology, in order to connect to the digital world,
one needed a keyboard, mouse and screen. I made a few projects that
combined the virtual world *Second Life* and the physical world on stage
using laptops. The audience and the performers both had their own
virtual avatars. They really identified with their virtual alter egos
and were enabled to communicate with each other via these digital
characters (performance installation *AKI ANNE*^5^). However the laptop
and screen were needed to interact. As a reaction, Embodiment became an
important topic in my work (and in society too). How to incorporate the
whole body with all its senses instead of only eyes and hands, in the
interaction with technology? The start of Kinects and balance boards;
physical and haptic devices that enabled the participants to physically
connect to the digital world. I created objects that had a variety of
sensors embedded. These objects invited the audience to interact with
them, in order to communicate and connect to the digital world and at
the same time stimulated them to focus on their own body (see example
*Cylinder\_RollingStairs\_Seesaw* ^6^).

I missed this Embodiment in Virtual Reality, while the immersed
experience, wearing the Oculus Rift was again restricted to the eyes and
ears. Putting on VR goggles, it enabled me to only look around in the
virtual world, not move around there. I felt nauseous after the
experience. It was because my head was immersed in the digital world but
my body was still at the same place. The feeling was similar to being
carsick, where the body is not able to catch up with the speed and the
surroundings. Mind and body become divided. After that, I stayed away
from VR for a bit. As a reaction to this experience, I created an
installation in which only parts of the body, like the arm or the head,
were connected and expanded into the digital reality: by wearing an
interactive glove it would give your arm an immersed virtual feeling
(*PPI 1-3* ^7^). However, things have developed and now you can actually
walk around in digital space while wearing VR headsets, creating a more
embodied experience. This way, the disconnection between mind and body
doesn’t happen anymore. The installation *Treehugger* is a good example
for this, in which it is possible to see, listen and sense the digital
environment with the hands and via the back (small motors in a
backpack), among other bodily sensations. It gets more interesting for
me now!

\#6. Can you share with us, some of your interesting finds at the Cinekid Medialab?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I experienced an interesting artwork at the Medialab called
*Tafelgeheim*, a virtual reality installation, that features a drawn
animated conversation between a father and a daughter. One needed to sit
at a table opposite another participant. I had the role of the father
and saw my daughter sitting in front of me. While the environment was
drawn it became somehow easier to immerse oneself into the story, to
have an embodied experience although it was impossible to move or
influence the images. The two characters start to converse about owl
pellets, but then get swallowed by memories of their deceased family
member Lisa: her sister, and his daughter. At one point, when the father
is talking, I felt myself sinking into water. A few drawn lines had so
much effect! It was a powerful experience since the feeling of sinking
into the water was a-like being drowned in your sorrows.
