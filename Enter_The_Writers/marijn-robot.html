She writes reflections for Vrij Nederland on theatre, television, films and thrillers
(for example the annual Detective & Thrillergids). <p> <br> She also works in the theatre as a
playwright and director. She likes stories and scenes to slowly unravel and
reveal themselves, and sees the use of tension as equally important in theatre and a literary thriller.</p></br>

<p>Can a computer make you burst into tears? It certainly can if you're sat behind your screen ready to buy tickets for the concert of a favorite pop star, only to find that the system is overloaded, and the concert is sold out by the time you get through. A delaying factor is currently the additional check that ticketing programs insert to find out if you actually are human.</p>

<p>Smart operators can install robots on ticket sites that can buy up the cards quickly and in large quantities; bypassing the maximum quota of four purchases per person. Sometimes the counter-checks are amazingly simple. You get a pop-up screen, where you can tick a box to confirm the statement, “I'm not a robot.” Regardless of the philosophical implications round this complex issue, this check doesn’t feel a very secure one. A more trustworthy method is when the buyer must answer a question based on a mosaic of photos the size of a postage stamp. “On how many pictures can you see a mountain?”, is an easy one to carry out. “On how many pictures can you see farm machinery?”, is a lot less simple. And the question, “On how many pictures can you see a street sign?”, meant I had to begin over and over again because I knew nothing about street signs.</p>

<p>But a robot that hinders internet purchases is a blessing in other situations. In 2013, the children's charity Terre des Hommes launched a virtual girl trying to catch suspected paedosexuals online. The Amsterdam advertising agency Lemz helped design this chat-robot, disguised as a ten year old girl from the Philippines named ‘Sweetie’. Those attracted to young girls paid online to Skype with this robot. This payment was then recorded and passed on to Interpol. Thanks to this pilot project, Interpol have already convicted over a thousand paedosexuals worldwide.</p>

<p>This month, an enhanced version of Sweetie was brought out. Recently I heard an interview with her designers on the radio. The interviewer then contacted her, and her chat responses were read out. Essential to how Sweetie operates is that she does not provoke any paedophiles, because that is prohibited by law. “She's very patient” said its designer softly, who then said with some pride, “She can perform twenty chats simultaneously”. This computer girl has already made a lot of people cry. And I don’t mean the investigators involved in this project, who know exactly how horrific a practice that attracts seven hundred thousand men at any time of the day - looking for a sexual partner of ten years or younger - is. Where the world can rejoice at the launch of Sweetie 2.0, is at the tears of the convicted ‘pleasure seekers’ and their associates.</p>
