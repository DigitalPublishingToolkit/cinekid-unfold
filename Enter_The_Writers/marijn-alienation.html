                    <h1>Removing the alienation</h1>
                    <h3> By Marijn van der Jagt</h3>

                    <p>Someone wearing VR glasses seems to be shunning reality. The thick black goggles cuts the wearer off from their environment, and if there is a headset (replete with an alternative soundscape) then the insulation is complete. The body
                        is still here, but the the eyes and ears have transported consciousness elsewhere. You can hear the cultural pessimists sighing, “yet another device that distracts people from the here and now”.</p>

                    <p>But this scenario doesn’t need to be the case. The virtual reality project, In The Eyes Of The Animals, created by the London art collective Marshmallow Laser Feast, has created VR glasses that ensure a much stronger connection with
                        the environment “the wearer” is in. The project takes place in the middle of a wood, and the walk to it prepares the participants to experience a natural rather than an urban environment. An egg-shaped helmet, replete with a mossy
                        “'eye”, and a harness with a carapace turns the participants into science fiction figures; though the landscape they are “transported to” is, in fact, the wood they just entered. The wood itself is presented through the eyes of
                        its inhabitants; namely, a mosquito, a dragonfly, a frog and an owl. </p>

                    <p>The “technocrats” in the artist collective have collected information about these particular insects and animals and translated them into “natural recordings”, from the creatures’ perspectives. Their work has created a magical experience
                        of colours and textures; one which overrides any human perceptions. A mosquito, for example, experiences its environment through carbon dioxide, which it perceives as airborne particles. A frog is able to look both under and above
                        the surface of the pond it swims in. The carapace used in. In The Eyes Of The Animals also gives the wearer of the VR goggles certain physical sensations; if the dragonfly flies, the wearer feels the vibration of the wings and
                        if the frog croaks, the wearer feels the sound resonating through their upper body.</p>

                    <p>“We've had participants throwing off their helmets, howling”, said author and creator Ersinhan Ersin last week, at a presentation of the project in London. The VR successfully takes the participant to “somewhere else”, deep into the
                        “world” of the wood. The overriding question raised by this project is therefore one of empathy. This latest technological game seems to have overcome the alienation between humans and nature. For, once you see how beautiful the
                        shifting CO2 contours that configure a human body in the eye of a mosquito acually are, you have some notion of what a wonderful lifeform you try to kill in your bedroom.</p>
