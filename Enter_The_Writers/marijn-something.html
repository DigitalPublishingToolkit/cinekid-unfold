            <p><b> Marijn van der Jagt (1963)</b> is a playwright and art journalist. She writes reflections for Vrij Nederland on theatre, television, films and thrillers (for example the annual Detective & Thrillergids).
                <p> <br> She also works in the theatre as a playwright and director. She likes stories and scenes to slowly unravel and reveal themselves, and sees the use of tension as equally important in theatre and a literary thriller.</p>

                    <p>The importance of weight and volume is seriously underestimated in the quest for ever smaller devices. Just as with a loved one, you want to have something to hold on to. The complaint that you can’t slam down the receiver of a mobile
                        phone after a frustrating conversation is not just a nostalgic one. Given this device is so important in everyday life, you also want to be able to put up a fight.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays you are punished by your own guilt when you furiously slam your phone down on the table: shocked, you immediately check if the poor thing still works. You can no longer take your emotions out on equipment, as all that remains
                        is a feeble rebuke, as the American comedian Louis C.K. showed in his <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5658560/louis-ck-the-shittiest-cell-phone-in-the-world-is-a-miracle">great sketch</a> about phone users who rail against their providers
                        for slow connection speeds. ‘The signal goes through a satellite into space!’ Louis C.K. yells at these frustrated ‘time-managers’, ‘So you got a minute? It is a miracle of technology that you have in your hands. What have you
                        actually performed in your life?’</p>

                    <p>This week it was announced that American scientists have developed a technique to use the <a href="http://www.nu.nl/gadgets/4257796/arm-gebruiken-als-touchscreen-smartwatches.html">human arm as a touchscreen</a> for operating a smart
                        watch. This method is necessary, as the buttons on the unit are so small that either the users can’t see them or their fingers are too thick to operate them. This is news that will satisfy Louis C.K. Rage resulting from difficult
                        communication with others, or a slow Internet connection, can now be vented on one’s very own limbs.<br>The technique still needs improvement, according to scientists, because sweaty skin creates problems in the operation of the
                        arm. Amusing images come to mind: limbs that have been abused by sharp nail imprints, chafed red 'rub' spots, or bruised memories of an angry pinch. Maybe this hitch in technological progress isn’t so unpleasant. At least you have
                        something to hold on to, albeit only your own body.</p>
