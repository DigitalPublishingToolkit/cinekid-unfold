    <h1>Cinekid Unfold</h1><br>
    <p>Cinekid Unfold is about playfulness, a curated playground of sorts, that contains a wealth of information. The idea is to create a space where you can discover information and their varied connections, unfolding the playground of technologies and data. Amidst the sheer excitement hanging in the air and impatient happy kids waiting for their turns to try out new interactive artworks, we set out to document the Cinekid Festival.</p><br>
    <br>

    <p>The result is this online platform, inspired by the offline festival “Cinekid for Professionals” which was held at Westergasfabriek, Amsterdam, from 14th October to 20th October 2016. Our objective is to digitize the essential concept behind the artworks presented at the festival and the feedback that we received by kids and professionals alike. We, the PublishingLab team, captured the festival, collecting images, videos and interviewing artists who presented their artworks at the Cinekid Medialab. We studied the interaction between the artworks and the people, the possibilities of various technologies we aim to dive in, and the future of all things digital, which affect our daily lives. We were inspired by the artworks displayed at the Cinekid Medialab, and came out with an idea to design few webpages as games, which interact with the user. Some of the games are inspired by a separate artwork and all of them are developed in order to provide information in the most playful manner.</p><br>
    <br>

    <p>So go ahead, navigate through our interactive games and gain knowledge about topics you are passionate about!</p><br>
